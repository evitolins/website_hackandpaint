SUNWALKER
=======================================

SUNWALKER is an open world, story-driven, inspirational, emotional, VR game. It’s a story about discovery and world-exploration, where the players create the narrative themselves, rather than being guided ‘on rails’.

### Freedom
We are creating an open-world experience. Rather than putting the player ‘on rails’, we are empowering the player to create their own narrative in this strange and unknown world, by allowing them to experience the expanse of this epic VR environment, while building an emotional connection with the character.

### Innovation
By leveraging our teams experience in gaming, feature animation, VFX, and video storytelling, our game offers a mix of unique camera positioning, allowing the player to be fully immersed in the VR experience. With clear visuals, fast and precise tracking, and no visual inconsistencies, players are free to explore the digital world without motion sickness.

### Engagement
Until now, most of the VR games are either short experiences or arcade-like games, rather than deep, immersive, emotional stories. We want to change that by leveraging our experience working on Oscar winning titles, and apply it to the environment, characters, interaction, and adventures of our game - ultimately making immersive gaming even more immersive in VR.
