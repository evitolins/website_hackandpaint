### Martina Petkov
With a background in psychology, I have always been intrigued by what motivates people. More than ten years of experience in academia and the private sector, exploring the mechanisms of consumer behaviour, have convinced me that effective communication is the foundation for success.



### Jon Lin
Since birth, Jonathan's Asian parents wanted him to be a Doctor.  From the early age of 10, Jonathan started studying for the SATs.  By age 16, he achieved a less-than-maximum SAT score of 2240, ranking only 98th percentile in the nation.  After his high school graduation, Jonathan set ablaze his massive collection of SAT books in a cathartic bonfire overlooking a sunset in Huntington Beach, CA.  His younger brother had to buy new SAT books to study that year.  Jonathan has never been arrested.

Jonathan Lin graduated from the School of Visual Arts in 2012 with a BFA in Computer Animation and Visual Effects.  After college, he worked as a Modeler at Blue Sky Studios for 4 years, receiving credits for his remarkable work in "Epic", "Rio 2", "Peanuts", "Ice Age 5", "Ferdinand", and other unannounced films.  At Blue Sky, Jonathan was quickly distinguished for his amazing Character Modeling abilities and eccentric yet endearing affinity for automatic rifles.  Less distinguished, Jonathan also modeled approximately 10,000 unique rocks throughout his Blue Sky career.  Jonathan has never seen rocks the same way again.

In 2016, Jonathan left Blue Sky to co-found Hack and Paint.  He has never felt more fulfilled with his life decisions.  He still dreams in polygons.

Jonathan's SAT books are survived by sketchbooks, passion, and a vision for a brighter, more colorful future.
